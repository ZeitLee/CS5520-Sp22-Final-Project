# CS5520-Sp22-Final-Project
This is the final project for Northeastern University CS5520 Spring 2022.

Note: If you try to test this app by changing the System time, after you finish the notification testing, do not forget to change the time back to network-provided time. Since incorrect System time may cause Wifi connection limitation or even Network error.

Note2: When you change the system time, all the notifications on the time period you jump over will be triggered. e.g. N1 is a monthly notification, N2 is a daily notification, if the System time has been set to one month (31 days) later, not only N1 will be triggered once, N2 will also be triggered 31 times.
